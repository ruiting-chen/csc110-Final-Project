\section*{Problem Description and Research Question}

Since the industrial revolution, humans have altered the world greatly from polluting the environment to destroying the habitat. We uninhibitedly release greenhouse gases into the air causing global warming, leaving heavy metals around mines to wipe out local plants, deforest Amazon for farming, and gazing. As a result, the species extinction rate of the world has soared from one species per decade to six thousand species per year, which has increased sixty thousand-fold! Yet in the past, humans have taken this for granted. We indeed alter the environment and many species go extinct, but it does not affect us. In fact, our metropolis mushroomed all around the world; airplanes flying high above the sky carrying people to explore previously unreachable places; factories had been built across the globe sending manufactured goods to everybody to improve our life. Even the moon, which our ancestors can only fancy about, has been reached. It seems all fine. But does it?\\
Gradually and unnoticeable by the proud humans, the Earth is altering and a great danger appears on the horizon -- the Raising of the sea level. There are two main reasons for raising the sea level, all of them are due to the increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As there are more and more greenhouse gases released into the air, it begins trapping sunlight which increases the temperature of the Earth. This in turn melts the ice on the north and south pole. The melted water flows into the sea, which raises the sea level. (“Why Are Glaciers and Sea Ice Melting?”) Also, as temperature rises, water tends to expand, directly leading to increased sea levels. Finally, as the sea level increases, more and more ice on the poles will be submerged underwater, and begin to melt itself. This is crucial because as the underlying ice melt, the iceberg fell into the sea which will eventually disappear resulting in a self-enhancing loop. ("NASA Sea Level Change Portal: Thermal Expansion.")\\
The rising sea level directly affects human society. First, a devastating tsunami will visit the coastline more frequently causing thousands of lives and money. The deconstruction of shelters will also turn people into refugees. What is more, seawater will taint the coastal farms and add salt into the soil which reduces the crop yield. Last but not the least, many cities located near the sea are directly threatened by the rising sea level. Following the current trend, big metropolis like London, San Diego, New York, and countries like the Netherlands will soon be submerged underwater. (Lewis, Sophie)\\

Given these important threatens, it is emergent to be aware and understand climate change and the rising sea level, and to treat them seriously.\\

Our research question is "How does sea-level change around the world due to climate change?”

\newpage
\section*{Dataset Description}
We gathered sea level data from the University of Hawaii Sea Level center website(UHSLC Legacy Data Portal). The data downloaded from this website includes a collection of daily sea level recording (unit: mm) from different sea level stations across the world during the time span indicated in the data stored in .dat format. An example of sea level data from one station(Peter \& Paul Rocks Brazil) is shown in the image below.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{Example of Sea Level Data}
\label{fig:sample_data.JPG}
\end{figure}

Each data set contains a header(first row of data) and the body of the sea level data(the rest of the rows).\\ 

Header structure(from left to right):
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    station index: 3 digits station number followed by one letter from A to Z
    \item
    name and region of the station
    \item
    start and end year of data collection
    \item
    latitude and longitude of the station
    \item
    decimation method, Coded as 
    1 : filtered,
    2 : simple average of all hourly values for a day,
    3 : other
    \item
    reference offset: constant offset to be added to each data value for data to be relative to tide staff zero or primary datum in same units as data
    \item
    reference code: R = data referenced to datum,
X = data not referenced to datum
    \item
    unit of measurement
\end{itemize}

Body structure(from left to right):
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    station index: 3 digits station number followed by one letter from A to Z
    \item
    name and region of the station
    \item
    year of data collection 
    \item
    julian day: day count from 1 Jan for 1st data point of each record followed by letter J for clarity
    \item
    12 daily sea level values(missing data indicated by(9999))
\end{itemize}


\section*{Computational Plan}

In order to let the data set be convenient for a computer to use, our group will turn the data which is used to be written in .dat file to the .csv format to let python conveniently use this file to do complicated operations. Then we will create a new dataclass named “sea\_level\_station” and design a function to read all the data from the CSV file and create dataclass instance for each station. In the next step, based on our data set, there is some missing value that exists, thus we could use “for row in data(for loop skill)” to extract only observations with not-missing value (except 9999) for the specific variable which we intend to investigate the rise of sea-level. After this step, we could mutate (rename) the new data class as “sea\_level\_station”, then because the data type in our new data set is the continuous variables in the quantitative data type (Chopra \& Alaudeen(2019) page 1), thus we decide to use the histogram, linear regression, and the animation to present data by using Pygame.\\
First, we will design a function to draw a histogram which will be done using plotly. We want to design a function to take a year as the argument and plot a histogram to illustrate the number of stations that report the sea level in a certain range at that certain year(y-axis), and the x-axis will be the interval of different sea levels(no gaps). \\
Second, we want to present the relationship between the year (x-axis) and average daily sea-level value over the last 50 years(y-axis). We will first plot all the points out and then draw linear regression based on these points in the graph. What is more, we will also design a function to use linear regression to predict future changes in sea levels at different stations. \\
Finally, we decided to use pygame to draw an animation about how the sea-level changes at all our stations from the past 50 years to the future 50 years on a world map, using the sea level data from our data set and the future data generated by the function that predicts future sea levels changes. In the animation, we decide to use colour code to represent the rise or decline of the sea level. For stations which reported rising sea level, we will use a gradient from yellow to red to illustrate the intensity of how much sea level raised. For stations that reported falling sea level, we will use a gradient from light blue to dark blue to illustrate the intensity of how much sea-level falls. Then as time moves forward, the colour will change, given the change in the rising and falling sea level as a vivid animation.\\
The pygame has the ability to draw animation which makes it relevant because by using pygame to draw animation, we can have a direct visualization of the data. As we depict the rising and falling of the sea level as time moves forward, the animation conveys in a vivid way the data which is just what we want to study. \\
Using pygame to draw animation is also appropriate because it reflects how sea level has changed in the past 50 years and how it will change in the future 50 years. This will give us valuable intuition on the data and also the importance of climate change. For example, when you see that as time passes, more and more areas become yellow and the colour gets darker and darker towards red, you will immediately realize the significance of climate change on our world and how less time we have. Thus, by viewing the animation, one will realize that the problem of climate change is something that we must treat seriously.
